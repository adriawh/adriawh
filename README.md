## Latest project 🚀
Over the summer of 2022 i was an intern at Zedge. Here, together with 3 other students, we developed and published an Android application. During the project i learnt to program in kotlin and create apps for android. I got more familiar with figma for both designing the user interface and creating a wireframe, aswell as creating graphics for the app. Furthermore we looked into firebase and amplitude to learn from the userdata the app produced. The app can be found at https://marsgif.app.

All screenshots and feature graphic seen in play store is made by me, using figma.
